#Because the data used is monthly seasonality, the output of this model use the last observation month, September 2023, to predict the next 5 months.

The level of the second part represents the trend of the data, indicating that there is an overall upward trend during this period, and the trend has declined after 2022. The level estimate is then used to forecast future values.

#I choose MAE as the accuracy measure, MAE is Mean Absolute Error, the smaller its value, the better, indicating that the modelâ€™s prediction is more accurate. Through comparison, the model forecast_MA9's MAE=1.481609, is the smallest of all models. it can be concluded that forecast_MA9 is the best model.
